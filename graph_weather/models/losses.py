        This re-scales each physical variable such that it has unit-variance in the 3 hour temporal
        difference. E.g. for temperature data, divide every one at all pressure levels by
        sigma_t_3hr, where sigma^2_T,3hr is the variance of the 3 hour change in temperature,
        averaged across space (lat/lon + pressure levels) and time (100 random temporal frames).

        Additionally weights by the cos(lat) of the feature.

        Args:
            feature_variance: variance for each of the physical features
            lat_lons: array of lat/lon, used to generate weighting
            device: device on which the variances and weights tensors are created
